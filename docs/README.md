# 🤖 AI-Powered Customer Support Chatbot with Knowledge Retrieval

## 📌 Overview

The **AI-Powered Customer Support Chatbot with Knowledge Retrieval** is an intelligent customer-support system that uses **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to provide accurate, relevant, and context-aware responses.

Traditional customer-support chatbots often depend on predefined rules and keyword matching, which can make them less effective for complex or naturally phrased customer queries.

Our system addresses this problem by retrieving relevant information from customer-support documents such as:

- FAQs
- Product Manuals
- Company Policies
- Warranty Documents
- User Guides
- Return and Refund Policies
- Shipping Policies

The retrieved information is provided to an LLM, which uses the context to generate a natural and knowledge-grounded response.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Organizations maintain large amounts of customer-support information across different documents. Customers may find it difficult to quickly locate the required information.

Traditional rule-based chatbots may not understand complex or differently phrased questions. At the same time, standalone LLMs may generate responses that are not based on the organization's actual policies or knowledge.

Therefore, this project aims to develop an intelligent customer-support chatbot that can:

- Retrieve relevant organizational knowledge
- Understand customer queries semantically
- Generate context-aware responses
- Provide the sources used for the response
- Estimate response confidence
- Maintain conversation context
- Escalate unresolved or low-confidence queries to human support

## 🎯 Objectives

- Develop an intelligent customer-facing support chatbot using an LLM.
- Implement Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).
- Use embeddings and FAISS for semantic knowledge retrieval.
- Generate accurate and context-aware responses.
- Provide source attribution and confidence information.
- Support multi-turn conversations using conversation history.
- Enable human-agent escalation for complex or unresolved queries.

# 🏗️ System Architecture

The project consists of two major phases:

## Phase 1 — Knowledge Base Preparation

The first phase prepares the organization's documents so they can be searched efficiently.
